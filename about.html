     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>
         My name's Chris Earis. I'm 23 years old, born and raised in Vancouver but currently living in New Westminister. I previously 
        studied Computer Science at Simon Fraser University before taking a year off and focusing on work. At SFU, most of what I 
        learned was theoretical and didn't feel like the right fit for me. Since BCIT was my other choice when applying for post 
        secondary education, I decided to reapply and see if the environment and style was a better a choice. After completing the Technology
        Entry program in Winter 2021, I was accepted into Computer Information Technology and am enjoying it so far.
